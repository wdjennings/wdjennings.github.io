							<h2> Timeline of the Universe  </h2>

							<p> Around 300,000 years after the Big Bang, the universe cooled enough that individual atoms began to form out of the plasma. These were the most simple atoms possible: neutral hydrogen, a single proton and a single electron. Over the following billion years, gravity caused these invidual atoms to fall together, forming stars and galaxies. </p>							
							<p>Around the same time, something interesting happened to the electric charge of the universe. If we observe the universe now, almost all the hydrogen atoms we can see are fully electrically charged. But the hydrogen atoms from the Big Bang were electrically neutral. At some point, somehow, the universe went from 100% neutral to 100% electrically charged.</p>

							<p>The time over which this change happened is known as the <strong>Epoch of Reionization</strong>, and out current best guess is that it started 500 million years after the Big Bang, and lasted for around 500 million more years. </p>

							<h2> 21cm Radiation  </h2>
							<p>What caused reionization? When exactly did it start? How long exactly did it take? These questions have not yet been answered -- partly because it's difficult to look so far back into the past. One of the most promising ideas is to look for 21cm radiation. This radiation is emitted by neutral hydrogen, but not by ionized hydrogen. By looking for the presence (or absence) of 21cm radiation, we should be able to catch the Universe in the act of reionization -- and figure out the culprit.</p>

							<h2>Simulations</h2>
							<p>The most popular theory is that reionization was caused by X-rays and ultraviolet radiation from the first stars and galaxies. There are so many different processes which affect reionization that the easiest way to model it is using simulations. The two simulations that I have used are called <a href="https://github.com/mariogrs/Simfast21">SimFast21</a> and <a href="https://github.com/andreimesinger/21cmFAST">21cmFast</a>.</p>
